 GOP codec assessment.
Refer to the docs folder for more info.

NOTE: HowToRun.md is incorrect for now. If you run in a docker
container, it may fail due to the time it takes
to install ffmpeg for the first time. In which case,
you'll have to try again. In the meantime, you can
use `./gradlew bootRun` to spin up the API and
run the project. Endpoint is `localhost:8080`.

## TODO

get working with docker

 GOP codec assessment.
Refer to the docs folder for more info.

Note: HowToRun.md is incorrect for now. The library doesn't 
want to cooperate with a docker image, so I can't get
the containers to work. In the meantime, you need
to use `./gradlew bootRun` to spin up the API and
run the project. Endpoint is `localhost:8080`.

## TODO
documentation

get working with docker

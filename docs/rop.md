# Railway Oriented Programming (ROP(?))

TIL ROP also stands for return oriented programming.
Alas, the limitations of language. Anyways, if I have
time I'll write more about this. More could have been 
done here, but I spent too much time trying to resolve
weird bugs so I didn't get a good chance to refactor. 
I will probably come back to this after the canvas project
though. 

In the meantime, 
here are links to both the resources I pulled from
and more info about ROP conceptually.

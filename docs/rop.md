# Railway Oriented Programming (ROP(?))

TIL ROP also stands for return oriented programming.
Alas, the limitations of language. Anyways, if I have
time I'll write more about this. For now, I only used it
on the first endpoint since it's fairly simple. I would also
like to convert the other endpoints but we'll see if I 
ever get to them. In order for this doc to be productive, 
I'd need to have successfully accomplished that first. 
In the meantime, 
here are links to both the resources I pulled from
and more info about ROP conceptually.

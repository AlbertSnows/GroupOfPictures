# Railway Oriented Programming (ROP(?))

TIL ROP also stands for return oriented programming.
Alas, the limitations of language. Anyways, if I have
time I'll write more about this. 

ROP is a programming 
paradigm that aligns with how I've come to think about
software design. Error states are not just bizzare, rare
exceptions; they're states of your program and should 
thus be handled just as deliberately as the happy path. 
I stil have a lot of guard clauses that could be cleaned 
up, but I did get to try it out in a few places. 
More could have been 
done here, but I spent too much time trying to resolve
weird bugs so I didn't get a good chance to refactor. 
I will probably come back to this after the canvas project
though. 

In the meantime, 
here are links to both the resources I pulled from during
previous time spent with ROP
and more info about ROP conceptually.

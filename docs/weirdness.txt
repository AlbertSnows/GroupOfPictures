        //Confusion: why doesn't this work???
//        var clipFilePath = new ClassPathResource(
//                String.format("static/" + videoNameWithoutExtension +"/" + escapedIndex),
//                getClass().getClassLoader());

// Answer: problem was not with class path, I was asking for the file before creating it
